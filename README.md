# HomemartApplication
###A text‐based user interface that allows both customers and employees to interact with the inventory.

##Task

Build a Java app that manages one overall arraylist for both sides of business (consumers and administrators). Customers can purchase
items as long as them are in inventory and managers can view how much stock is left and restock appropriately, as well as adjust pricing

##Criteria

Code must be organized according to the Model-View-Controller standard
Code is tested informally (Without the use of JUnit testing)
Two Model classes, Three View classes, and one controller class

##Summary of Tech Stack Because this program is meant to showcase a mastery of simple fundamentals the only tech stack used is Java out of 
the box. Core concepts used are:
Basics of hardware, software, and programming languages, Data and expressions, Decision and repetition structures, Arrays and ArrayLists,
Writing and using classes and objects, Object‐oriented design, Coding best practices

##Functionality This app uses two seperate model classes, one for a shoppers data and another for the inventory data. Three classes are used
for the view class, one for the manager interaction, one for the shopper interaction, and the main homemart interaction that serves as the 
intermediary of the former. I would like to one day work on the project latterand implement some type of GUI to make it more lively.
